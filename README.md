# `easage`

A library that provides programmatic manipulation of BIG archives.

---

## What is a `BIG` archive?

BIG files are an archive format used in many games published by Electronic Arts.
The supported features vary between games, with some using compression or
encryption, but for SAGE, the files are trivially concatenated together and
wrapped with a header containing a series of index entries that located a given
file within the archive.

Noteable games built on the SAGE engine are:
* Battle For Middle-Earth (1, 2, RotWK)
* Command & Conquer Generals (and the expansion Zero Hour)

## Building

You must have the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) toolchain installed (which includes `cargo`):

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Running

Included in this source tree is a command-line application named `easage` that uses the `easage` library.

You can build this application like so:

```sh
cargo build --bin easage --features="clap" --release
```

The output binary will be written to `target/release/easage`.

You can invoke this directly or put it somewhere on your shell's `$PATH`.

### Examples:

```sh
easage list path/to/a/file.big
```

```sh
easage pack --source test_data --output output/path.big
```

```sh
easage extract --source path/to/a.big --output the/directory/to/extract/into/
```
